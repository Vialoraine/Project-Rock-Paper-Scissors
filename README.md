  ## Description
  In this practice project repository, I used my knowledge of JavaScript conditionals to create an online game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer.
  
  Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.
  
  The possible outcomes are:
  * Rock destroys scissors.
  * Scissors cut paper.
  * Paper covers rock.
  * If thereâ€™s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
